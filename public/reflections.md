# Reflections - 1st Quarter Portfolio

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. 

1. ++Arithmetic Operators++ 
   Arithmetic operators are the basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This is one of the easiest topics since we have been doing this for 3 years for CS. It is really useful in coding and most importantly in loops.
2. ++Variables and Data Types++   
   Variables are like save files, it stores values and defines value. This is one the most basic things about coding in CS and use all around. Understanding how variables work is really useful especially in fucntions. 
3. ++Comparison Operators++
   Comparison operators are used for true or false statements. Examples are >, <, ==, and !=. This topic is very important especially in loops to see when the loop will stop. This is easy since we use this lesson in CS a lot.
4. ++Conditional Statements++  
   Conditional statements allow programs to do decisions. Statements like if, if-else, else, are really important and easy to understand. It makes coding easier to understand and really beginner friendly. 
5. ++Loops (for and while)++  
   Loops are like structures that repeat something until the said condition is met. I understand them well since we did exercises on creating loops to repeat tasks automatically. This is one of the most important topics in CS since this is used a lot in with conditional statements, arithmetic operators, and many more topics that are connected.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.

1. ++Functions++ – I know that functions are making a code inside of a code. I get confused on how to properly define and call them. I need more practice to understand parameters and return values.  
2. ++Nested Loops++ – I understand the concept, but I sometimes mix up which loop to use and what it does, especially in more complex problems.  
3. ++Arrays++ – **Input/Output (I/O) Statements** – Sometimes I forget the correct syntax or mix up when to use certain commands.  
4. ++Logical Operators++ – I make mistakes in combining conditions using &&, ||, and !. 
5. ++Debugging++ – I need more practice in finding and fixing errors in my code. Sometimes I get stuck when errors appear.

## 3. Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

To improve on functions, I plan to practice by making programs that use simple functions. For nested loops, I will solve more exercises that involve patterns. For logical operators, I will do more exercises that combine multiple conditions. Finally, for debugging, I will practice reading my code carefully and also try to use tools or techniques like adding console.log statements to trace errors.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

++Effective Activities:++  
1. Do coding exercises to understand and practice things I find hard.  
2. Have and ask questions to the teacher or to your classmates. Asking help from others isn't wrong and will help you a lot.  

**Not Effective Activities:**  
1. Long lectures without exercises were less effective because it was hard to keep up without applying the lesson in anyway.  
2. Copying notes from the presentation was not effective at all because I learned better by doing practice in coding.
